# Static-Web-Page

This is an individual assignment to help you practice making prototype pages.

You are required to design and develop a complete static website. This website will be for a gallery of animals of your choice. These are the specific requirements for the site.

Read everything before you get started.

Static Website
The website must consist of a home page (index.html) and at least 2 child pages.
index.html:
The main page of the gallery. This must display at least 5 animals, including a picture and summary of details for each animal.
details.html
One page dedicated to one of the animals displayed on the main gallery page. This page should have more details about the specific animal. (Only one details page is sufficient, no need for individual details pages for each and every animal in your gallery. You can make all the animals in the gallery link to this one details page.)
about.html
an about page for your static website. You have the liberty to choose what goes on this page. This page must consist of at least one image and some significant text. 
Each page must contain the same navigation menu to link to all the other pages.
Your site must be neat, visually appealing and easily readable. Here are some sample screenshots of what your website could look like: dogano-dogs-static.zip. Download dogano-dogs-static.zip.I also included a picture that shows my file directory. Feel free to be creative and make your own design, not just copy my simple one!

Use Google. You may run into roadblocks while figuring out what to do. Do what every developer does; look it up. I suggest using libraries such as Bootstrap or PureCSS to ease the burden of styling things from scratch. My example uses Bootstrap.

How
Create a new PUBLIC GitHub repository that you will use for this assignment. Clone it to your local workspace.

Start adding files. Get into the habit of creating commits every so often. Do not wait until the entire project is done to make one giant commit.

Push your changes back to GitHub. Enter a link to the repo here on Canvas.
